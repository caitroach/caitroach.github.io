# BEHOLD!

A personal website is a powerful asset to any computer science student. It's a great way to showcase your skills to recruiters, post about on LinkedIn, and put on your resume. Unfortunately I can't do any of that because my site is horrifically unprofessional. 


This started because I wanted my Letterboxd and Goodreads in one link, and now I write personality quizzes and fight web audio API. 


Because raw HTML is nightmarish, I think the only good way to learn is to express yourself in a genuinely fun and engaging way. Maybe someday I'll make a better looking portfolio but today i am 19 and i like cat gifs.


domain was $2 from porkbuns and the site is static HTML/CSS/JS hosted on github pages. guestbook by Hyvor Talk.
